\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The goal of this document is to present a notation for GraphBLAS algorithms and showcase it using important GraphBLAS algorithms.

% The latest recent introductory paper to GraphBLAS is from 2018~\cite{DBLP:conf/cf/KumarMP18}. Since then, new operations have been added and we also attempted to streamline the notation.

% Future work: GBBS~\cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/DhulipalaSTBS20}

% Ongoing work:
% distributed API~\cite{DBLP:conf/ipps/BrockBMMMPSS20},
% C++ API~\cite{DBLP:conf/ipps/BrockBMMM20},
% CPU implementation (Joe Eaton et al.)
